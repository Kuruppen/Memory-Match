Memory Match Game
A classic card-matching game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to find all pairs of matching cards in the fewest number of moves and the shortest amount of time.

Features
Core Gameplay: The game board consists of a grid of cards, each with a hidden letter. You click on a card to reveal its letter, and then click a second card to see if it's a match. The goal is to match all pairs in the shortest time and with the fewest moves.

Performance Tracking: The app includes a scoreboard that keeps track of your moves and the time elapsed as you play.

AI-Powered Messages: When you win the game, you can click a button to get a personalized, congratulatory message generated by an AI model, the Gemini API, which uses your final moves and time to create a unique response.

Player Controls: You can pause the game at any time to temporarily stop the timer, and you can reset the board to start a new game from scratch.

How to Play
Click on any card to flip it over.

Click a second card to see if it's a match.

If the cards match, they will remain face-up. If not, they will flip back over after a short delay.

Continue until you've matched all the pairs to win the game!
